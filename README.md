# Game Description

- Our game is a C++ version of the very popular TV show "Who wants to be a millionaire". Everyone wants a shot at this game but the reality is that this isn't possible. We believe our game would help people feel the adrenaline of the TV show and put their own skills to the test.
- Every correcty answered question adds some value to the players wallet. The sequential values at questions are **$500, $1000, $2000, $5,000, $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, $75,000, $150,000, $250,000, $500,000 and finally, $1,000,000**. If the user manages to reach $1,000,000, they are said to have beaten the game.
- The game involves questions from a variety of topics including mathematics, science, general knowledge, and history. Players can only answer correctly for every question â€“ any incorrect answer would lead to direct disqualification.
- Players have 4 lifelines to use over the course of a session. They are:
  -  **Fifty-Fifty**: When chosen, the two incorrect choices would be removed from the avilable options so the chances of a correct guess would rise from 25% to 50%. 
  -  **Second chance**: The user can choose another shot at any question only once during the entire course of his/her game. However, the catch to this is that if the user decided to avail this lifeline, they would taken one step back from where they currently are. For example let's say the user is at $50, 000 right now and playing for $75, 000. They get the answer wrong, but go for the 'second chance' lifeline. As a result, they would now be at $20, 000 and playing for $50, 000 (taken a step back).
  -  **Phone a friend**: **USES RANDOMNESS, SO EXPLAINED LATER**
  -  **Ask the audience**: **USES RANDOMNESS, SO EXPLAINED LATER**
